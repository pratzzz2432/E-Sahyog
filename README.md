# Disaster Management App: Centralized Communication and Response System

## Overview
The **Disaster Management App** is a Flutter-based solution designed to enhance disaster response and resource management. The app features a **dual-interface system**:

1. **User Interface (Civilians/Refugees)** – Provides emergency alerts, navigation to safe zones, medical record access, virtual training, and donation options.
2. **Government Interface (Central, State, Inventory Management)** – Manages disaster alerts, refugee centers, inventory tracking, and communication.

The system integrates **LoRa (Long Range) for critical low-bandwidth communication** and **Internet/Cellular networks for high-bandwidth tasks**, ensuring seamless communication even in disaster-hit areas.
